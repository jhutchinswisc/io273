Problem Sets for 14.273
=======================

Each problem set should have its own directory.

Problem Set 1
-------------

Code for the first problem set is run using the `main.m` file, which
runs all code, except code for section 2, question 3.  Section 2,
question 3 is separated in its own branch, called `sec2q3` because the
code incorrectly assumes exogenous prices. Keeping this code in a
separate branch ensures it doesn't accidently affect our main results.

The folder `ps1` should have the following sub-directories:

    data/      Save data generated by create_data.m
    tex/       Space for write-up of results
    tex/figs   Save histograms generated by create_data.m


Problem Set 2
-------------

Code for the second problem set is run using the `main.m` file. The
folder `ps2` should have the following sub-directories:

    data/      Save data generated by sim.m
    figs/      Place to save figures
